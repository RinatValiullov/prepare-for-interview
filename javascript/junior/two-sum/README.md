## Given an array of integers `numbers` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice [(leetcode "two-sum" task)](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum)

***

Input 1:

```
const numbers1 = [3, 2, 4];
const target1 = 6;
twoSum(numbers, target);
```

Output 1:

```
[ 1, 2 ]
```

Input 2:

```
const numbers = [-2, 1, 7, 3, 10];
const target = 5;
twoSum(numbers, target);
```

Output 2:

```
[ 0, 2 ]
```

Input 3:

```
const numbers = [5, 5];
const target = 10;
twoSum(numbers, target);
```

Output 2:

```
[ 0, 1 ]
```
