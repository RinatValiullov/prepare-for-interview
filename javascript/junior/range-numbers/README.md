## Write a function that generates an array of numbers starting with a specific position (parameter `from`), with a specific step (parameter `step`) and ending with a specific position (parameter `to`).

Input: `rangeNumbers({ to: 5 })`

Output: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`

Input: `rangeNumbers({ from: 5, to: 15 })`

Output: `[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]`

Input: `rangeNumbers({ from: 0, step: 2, to: 10 })`

Output: `[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]`
